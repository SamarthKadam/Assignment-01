# Assignment 01: Creating Recaman Sequence on a Number Line using Canvas API in JavaScript

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to build a web application using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API to visualize the Recaman sequence on a number line. The Recaman sequence is defined by the following rules:

1. Start at 0.
2. If the current number 'n' is greater than zero and has not been previously used, move 'n' steps backward.
3. If the number has been used before or moving backward would result in a negative number, move 'n' steps forward instead.

## Implementation Details

- **Canvas API**: Utilize the HTML5 Canvas API to draw the number line and visualize the sequence.
- **JavaScript**: Implement the logic for generating the Recaman sequence based on the defined rules.
- **User Interaction**: Provide controls or options for users to interact with the visualization, such as starting, pausing, or resetting the sequence.
